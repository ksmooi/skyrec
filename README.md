# AI Innovation in Smart Retail and Security Monitoring

During my tenure at SkyREC, I had the privilege of collaborating with a group of creative, passionate, and capable colleagues to develop a series of outstanding works. These works were mainly designed and developed between 2016 and 2022, focusing on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide solutions for smart retail and smart security monitoring.

Behind these solutions lies a deep technological content, including algorithm optimization, MLOps automation, high-performance AI inference server design, cloud architecture design, distributed system architecture design, and subscription system design. Each technical aspect is the result of our team's collective efforts, fully demonstrating our professional expertise and innovative capabilities in the field of AI.

AI NVR allows users to quickly and easily manage security systems in various environmental conditions, including indoor, outdoor, daytime, nighttime, and all seasons.
- Even under extreme weather conditions, such as strong sunlight, rainy days, typhoons, or snow, or when objects move at different speeds simultaneously (e.g., fast-moving vehicles and bicycles, as well as slower-moving bodies or faces), AI NVR can still provide the best image analysis results.
- Indoor and outdoor
- Day and night
- Suitable for all seasons
- Different weather types
- Various moving speeds
